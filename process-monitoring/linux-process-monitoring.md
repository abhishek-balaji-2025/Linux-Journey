# üêß Linux Introduction to Process Monitoring

## üìå What is Monitoring in Linux?

Monitoring in Linux refers to observing system behavior to detect:

- Suspicious activity  
- Potential future failures  
- Opportunities for performance improvement  

It allows administrators to take **precautionary measures** to mitigate issues **before** system failure occurs.

### üí° In simple terms:
> **Monitoring helps prevent system failure.**

## üß≠ Types of Monitoring in Linux

1. **Process Monitoring**
2. **File & Directory Monitoring**

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Are Processes in Linux?

A **process** is a **running task** in the background of a Linux system.  
Monitoring these processes helps you understand:

- System performance  
- Resource usage  
- Rogue or unwanted programs

## üîç Common Process Monitoring Tools

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `top`   | Displays real-time information about **all running processes** in the system. |
| `htop`  | An **interactive**, colorful, and user-friendly version of `top`. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful `ps` Command Variants

| Command             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `ps -a`             | Lists **all running processes** of **all users** in the **current terminal**. (No background daemons) |
| `ps -u`             | Shows processes **owned by the current user**. |
| `ps -u <username>`  | Displays processes for a **specific user**. |
| `ps -x`             | Lists **all background daemons** not attached to the terminal. |

## üß† Summary

- Process monitoring helps maintain system health.  
- Commands like `top`, `htop`, `ps`, and `pgrep` provide critical insights into running processes.  
- Knowing the right flags makes it easier to filter and find what you need.
