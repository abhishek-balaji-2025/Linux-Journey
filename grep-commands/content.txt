In a small town, there was an old clock shop run by a man named Mr. Thalen. He was quiet, kind, and always busy fixing clocks. People liked him, but no one knew much about him.

Every day, the same thing happened. Mr. Thalen opened his shop at 9 a.m., worked on clocks all day, and closed at 6 p.m. He never missed a day. He never looked any older.

One day, a girl named Mira walked into the shop. She loved stories and wanted to write about the clockmaker. She asked him, “Why do you still fix clocks when people use phones now?”

He smiled and said, “Because clocks remember time. Phones forget it.”

Mira didn’t really understand, but she liked his answer. She decided to visit him more often. Slowly, she learned that some old things—like clocks and kind people—are worth keeping.

In the end, every day was a happy day.
