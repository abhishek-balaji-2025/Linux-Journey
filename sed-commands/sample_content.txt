The cat blinked slowly.
Rain tapped on the window.

Someone laughed in the distance.
The coffee was too bitter.
A paper airplane flew by.
The light flickered twice.


She forgot why she entered the room.
A shoe lay in the middle of the road.
The clock stopped at 3:17.
Leaves danced in the wind.
He hummed an unfamiliar tune.
The moon was unusually bright.
A dog barked, then silence.
The phone buzzed once.
Something moved in the shadows.
